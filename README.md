Queue Implementation This Classes are designed for testing and learning purposes for beginners.

Code is written as simple and readable as possible, To much thing's are missing if we compare it to actual implementation from util package.
few things have to be deleted.

things you will meet at Queue  Implementation From scratch.

Queue  (Node Based, Circular Array Based) Circular Array Based Queue has fixed size. 
Deque (Array & Node Based) both resize automatically. 

upcoming: PriorityQueue will be added after Tree Directory appears in My Repositories. for that reason it has been postponed. 
classed work as intended, If you find any bug or error, comment below and i'll update the class.

Again Classes are for learning purposes, you can clone the repo and run it in your machine, 
Queue  interface wount be added to repo, just delete interface implementation and remove annotation's from methods.
